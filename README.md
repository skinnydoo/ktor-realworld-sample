# ![Ktor RealWorld Sample App](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-starter-kit/raw/master/logo.png)

> ### Ktor codebase written in a functional style containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/backend-specs/introduction) spec and API.

## [RealWorld](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app)

This codebase was created to familiarize myself with Ktor, as well as the [graphql-kotlin](https://opensource.expediagroup.com/graphql-kotlin/docs/) library. It includes CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.


For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

## Architecture Overview

The application uses a **package-by-feature** structure with the following packages:
1. `common`: contains technical configuration classes (e.g. for DI, database connection, connection pooling, logging, etc)
2. `users`: contains user related routes, domain models, entities and business logic
3. `articles`: contains article related routes, domain models, types and business logic
4. `profiles`: contains user profiles routes, domain models and business logic

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

#### MySQL

If you have a local MySQL database running on your computer - you are all set.
If you don't have MySQL installed, you can do it now by installing from: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/
and set it up with user name and password 

Make sure to create a database named **realworld** in your MySQL instance.

#### Run application with IntelliJ

Clone and open ktor-realworld-sample with IntelliJ IDE. Choose **Run / Edit Configuration** menu to create new
launch configuration. On the left side click **[+]** and select **Kotlin**. Name it **RealWorld Server** (or pick other name)
and fill up some essential fields:

- Main class: `io.skinnydoo.RealWorldAppKt`
- Environment variables: `JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here=;DB_USERNAME=root;DB_PWD=your-db-user-password`
- Use classpath or module: `ktor-realworld-sample.main`

You should be able to run/debug your app now.
